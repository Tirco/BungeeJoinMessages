    ##When a player swaps from A to B, which one should we check? JOINED, LEFT, BOTH, ANY
    ##Behaviour will change depending on the blacklist being in blacklist or whitelist mode.
    ##example: If you set this to JOINED: BlacklistMode will prevent the message from going through if the joined server is going through.
